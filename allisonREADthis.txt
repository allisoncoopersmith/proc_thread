The current implementation of the driver code is to take in inputs specifying the arraysize and the number of threads/procs a user is to enter
	so ./a.out arrSize thread/procNum

I have added some error checks to make sure the inputs are valid

I did it this way because manually changing sizes for extensive testing is too tedious (I think someone on piazza said it can be done this way)

I capped all proc/thread max to be 250, although the tests I did go up to 150 max because franny said to do it this way

the target is always 0, as this is the minimum index a valid array can have and if randomized, we are always searching for this in different places

You will see the two files that contain test data -- respectively named

Please download the code and make sure it runs on your machine as well!!
